_my todo list (seriously)_

[This is my todo list](todo.txt). It's not everything I need to do, as I have other mechanisms of managing tasks, but it's my latest attempt to stay organized and on top of things.

This list is in the [Todo.txt](http://todotxt.com/) format– a plain text standard for managing todo lists. It is kept in sync with a Dropbox using [committal](https://github.com/nquinlan/committal), so that applications with Dropbox sync (the de facto todo.txt sync standard) can interact with my list.

If you wish to add something to my todo list, please make a pull request, just make sure you maintain [Todo.txt format](https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli/wiki/The-Todo.txt-Format).
